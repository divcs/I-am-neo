String Output:

 puts: Outputs a string to stdout and adds a newline at the end.

Character Output:

 putchar: Outputs a single character to stdout.
 fputc: Writes a single character to a specified file stream.
 putc: Similar to fputc, writes a character to a file stream, but often used in macros.

Advanced Character Handling:

 fputs: Outputs a string to a specified file stream without automatically adding a newline.


C++ Output Functions

General Output:

 cout: Outputs data to stdout, handling various data types directly.
 cerr: Outputs error messages to the standard error stream (stderr), often unbuffered.
 clog: Outputs logging messages to the standard error stream (stderr), typically buffered.

String and Stream Output:

 cout << std::endl: Outputs a newline and flushes the output stream.
 cout << std::flush: Flushes the output buffer without adding a newline.
 stringstream: Allows writing data to a string as if it were a stream, useful for string formatting.

Character Output:

 cout.put(): Outputs a single character to cout.
 cout.write(): Outputs a specified number of characters from a buffer to cout.
