Problem Statement



You need to create a program that models geometric shapes, specifically rectangles and cubes. Implement a Rectangle class with attributes for width and length, and methods to compute its area. Extend this with a Cube class that inherits from Rectangle and includes a height attribute, computing the volume of the cube. Write a program that reads the width, length, and height of a cube from user input, then displays the cube's width, length, height, base area, and volume.



Formula



base height = width * length

volume = width * length * height 

Input format :
The input consists of three double-precision floating-point numbers on separate lines, which represent the dimensions of a cube: cubeWidth, cubeLength, and cubeHeight.

Output format :
The output displays the properties of the cube, including the width, length, height, base area, and volume, each on a separate line.



Refer to the sample output for exact specifications.

Code constraints :
The input values should be valid double-precision floating-point numbers.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
10.2
20.5
30.3
Output 1 :
Width: 10.2
Length: 20.5
Height: 30.3
Base area: 209.1
Volume: 6335.73
