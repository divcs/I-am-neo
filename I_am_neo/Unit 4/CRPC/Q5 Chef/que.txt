Problem Statement



Sita, a restaurant manager, needs to efficiently oversee both kitchen and service staff by tracking the number of dishes prepared and tables served. To streamline her calculations, she requires a program that uses multiple inheritance.



The program should define a base class Chef to manage dish-related data and another class Waiter to handle table-related information. A derived class Manager should inherit from both Chef and Waiter and implement methods to calculate and display the following: the average number of dishes per table (only if tables are served), and the total number of dishes and tables after adding a constant value of 10.



Note

Average = Total Number of Dishes x Number of Tables

Input format :
The first line consists of an integer N representing the number of dishes.

The second line consists of an integer M representing the number of tables.

Output format :
The output displays the following lines:

The total number of dishes in the format: Dishes: <totalDishes>.
The average number of dishes per table, rounded to 2 decimal places, in the format: Average: <averageDishesPerTable>..
The total number of dishes after adding 10, in the format: Total dishes: <updatedDishes>.
The total number of tables after adding 10, in the format: Total tables: <updatedTables>.


Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.
