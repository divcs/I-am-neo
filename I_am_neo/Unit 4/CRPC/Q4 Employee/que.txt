Problem Statement



John, a senior HR manager, needs a program to efficiently evaluate the performance and compensation of managers in his organization. Each manager's compensation includes a bonus, and their performance score depends on their salary and team size. To simplify this task, a program is required that uses multiple inheritance.



The program should define a base class Employee with attributes id and salary and a method to calculate a 10% bonus. Another class, TeamLead, will have attributes department and teamSize, along with a method to calculate the performance score. A derived class Manager should inherit both and display the results.



Formulae used:

Bonus Calculation = 0.10 x salary
Performance Score = Team size x (salary / 1000)
Input format :
The first line consists of an integer representing the id of the manager.

The second line consists of a double-point number representing the salary of the manager.

The third line consists of an integer representing the team size of the manager.

Output format :
The first line displays the "Bonus: " representing the bonus amount rounded to 2 decimal places.

The second line displays the "Team Performance Score: " representing the team performance score rounded to 2 decimal places.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ id ≤ 1000

0.00 ≤ salary ≤ 100000.00

1 ≤ team size≤ 100
