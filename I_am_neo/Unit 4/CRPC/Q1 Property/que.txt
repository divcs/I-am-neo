Problem Statement



Aarti is a real estate agent managing various properties, including houses. She needs to evaluate several financial aspects of each house, such as the total bedroom area, the discounted price after applying a 10% discount, and the cost to paint the house based on its area.



Write a program using single inheritance to model this task. Define a base class Property with attributes locationCode, price, and area. Extend this with a derived class House that includes additional attributes like number_of_bedrooms and methods to calculate the total bedroom area, the discounted price, and the cost to paint the house.



Formulas Used:

Total Bedroom Area = number_of_bedrooms * 200.0
Discounted Price = price - (price * 0.10)
Cost to Paint House = area * 5.0
Input format :
The first line contains an integer representing the location code

The second line contains a double price representing the price of the house.

The third line contains a double area representing the area of the house in square feet.

The fourth line contains an integer representing the number of bedrooms.

Output format :
The first line displays the "Total Bedroom Area: " representing the total Bedroom Area in square feet, formatted to 2 decimal places.

The second line displays the "Discount Price: " representing the discounted Price of the house, formatted to 2 decimal places.

The third line displays the "Cost to Paint House: " representing the cost to Paint the House, formatted to 2 decimal places.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.
