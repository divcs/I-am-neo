Problem Statement



Aarti, a real estate agent specializing in high-end residential properties, needs a system to evaluate luxury property values. The system should calculate:



Total Bedroom Value: Increases by 5.0 of the base price per additional bedroom.
Price With Luxury Tax: Adjusts the base price with a specified luxury tax rate.
Renovation Cost: Based on the property’s area, at Rs. 50 per square foot.
Total Property Value: Sum of the adjusted price and renovation cost.


The system should utilize a class hierarchy:

Property: Base class with attributes like property_id, price, and area.
ResidentialProperty: Derived class adding number_of_bedrooms and calculating bedroom value.
LuxuryProperty: Further derived class introducing luxury_tax_rate and calculating total property value.


Formulae Used:

Total Bedroom Value = Price x (1+(Number of bedrooms x 0.05))
Price with Luxury Tax = Price x (1+ Luxury Tax Rate)
Renovation Cost = Area x 50.0
Total Property Value = Price with Luxury Tax + Renovation Cost
Input format :
The first line consists of an integer representing the property id.

The second line consists of a double-point number representing the price of the property.

The third line consists of a double-point number representing the area of the property.

The fourth line consists of an integer representing the number of bedrooms.

The fifth line consists of a double-point number representing the luxury tax rate.

Output format :
The output displays the following format:

The total bedroom value is rounded to 2 decimal places: "Total Bedroom Value: <value>".

The total price with luxury tax is rounded to 2 decimal places: "Total Price: <value>".

The renovation cost is rounded to 2 decimal places: "Renovation Cost: <value>".

The total property value is rounded to 2 decimal places: "Total Property Value: <value>".



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.
