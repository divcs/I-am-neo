Problem Statement



John is managing his stock investments and wants to evaluate his transactions using a Stock class. The Stock class has methods to calculate profit or loss from buying and selling prices and uses operator overloading to perform certain calculations. John needs to:



Compute the profit or loss between two stock transactions using the subtraction operator (-).
Calculate the total price by adding the selling price and buying price of the same stock using the addition operator (+).
Display whether the transaction resulted in profit or loss and if the profit percentage is high.


Formulae Used:



The profit or loss is calculated based on the formula: profit = sellingPrice - buyingPrice.
The profit is considered "High" if it's more than 20% of the buying price.
Profit Percentage = (Profit / buyPrice) x 100
Input format :
The first line of input is an integer representing the buying price of a stock.

The second line of input is an integer representing the selling price of the same stock.

Output format :
The output displays the calculated profit, and if the profit percentage is greater than 20%, indicate a message in the following format:



If profit is positive: "Profit: <profit_value>".and "High Profit", separated by a line.



If profit is negative: "Loss: <profit_value>".



The last line of the output displays the total price of the buying and selling prices in the format:

"Total Price: <total_price>".



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.
