Problem Statement



Olivia wants to manage her personal bank account efficiently and is concerned about her balance. To achieve this, she needs a program that utilizes operator overloading (-) to apply a penalty of 10% (0.10) to her balance if it falls below a set threshold. The program should take her initial balance as input and compute the new balance after the penalty.



Based on the new balance, it should print one of the following messages: "Account Overdrawn" if the balance is Rs. 10 or less, "Warning: Low Balance" if the balance is between Rs. 10 and Rs. 500, or "Balance is sufficient" if it is Rs. 500 or more. Finally, the new balance should be displayed.

Input format :
The input consists of an integer, N, representing Olivia's initial account balance.

Output format :
The first line displays a message indicating the status of the account balance ("Account Overdrawn", "Warning: Low Balance", or "Balance is sufficient").

The second line displays an integer, representing the new balance after the penalty.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
