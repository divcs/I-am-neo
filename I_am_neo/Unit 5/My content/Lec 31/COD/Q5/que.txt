Robin is working on a program that helps students in a mathematics class. He is tasked to write a program to calculate and store the first 'n' terms of an arithmetic progression, given the initial term and the common difference.



The program should dynamically allocate memory for an array to store these terms and then compute and display the sum of the arithmetic progression. Help the students by writing a program that takes the necessary inputs and provides the expected output.

Input format :
The input consists of three space-separated integers n, t, and d.

An integer 'n', represents the number of terms in the arithmetic progression.
An integer 't', represents the first term of the arithmetic progression.
An integer 'd', represents the common difference between consecutive terms.
Output format :
The output displays an integer representing the sum of the arithmetic progression.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ n ≤ 150

1 ≤ t ≤ 250

1 ≤ d ≤ 50

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5 2 3
Output 1 :
40
Input 2 :
7 2 4
Output 2 :
