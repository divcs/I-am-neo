Problem Statement



Sakshi is tasked with analyzing numerical sequences to predict the next number based on their pattern. Implement a class SeriesAnalyzer that determines if a given sequence follows an Arithmetic, Geometric, or Fibonacci pattern. The class should use the following methods:



isArithmetic(): Checks if the sequence follows an Arithmetic pattern (constant difference between terms).
isGeometric(): Checks if the sequence follows a Geometric pattern (constant ratio between terms).
isFibonacci(): Checks if the sequence follows a Fibonacci pattern (each term is the sum of the two preceding terms).
analyzeAndPrint(): Analyzes the sequence and prints the next number in the sequence based on the identified pattern. If no pattern is matched, it prints -999. For Geometric sequences with non-integer results, ensure the output is printed with one decimal place.

Input format :
The first line consists of an integer n, representing the length of the series.

The second line consists of n space-separated list of integers representing the series.

Output format :
If the series is determined to be an Arithmetic or Fibonacci series, the output will be an integer.

If the series is determined to be a Geometric series and the next number is a non-integer, the output will be a floating-point number.

If the series doesn't match any type, the output will be -999.
