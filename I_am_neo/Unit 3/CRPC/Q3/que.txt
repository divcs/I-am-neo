Problem Statement



Kate is developing a calendar application that needs to determine the number of days in a given month of a specified year. To accomplish this, she will use a C++ class named MonthDays. 



This class will be designed to handle various functionalities including determining the number of days in any month while correctly accounting for leap years in February.



The MonthDays class should have:

A parameterized constructor to initialize the month and year.
A copy constructor to handle copying of objects.
A destructor to output a message when the object is destroyed.
A method named getDaysInMonth() that returns the number of days in the specified month of the given year.
Input format :
The input consists of two integers: month (1-12) and year (a positive integer).

Output format :
For valid months (1-12), the output should display "Number of days is " followed by the number of days in the specified month of the given year.

For invalid months (not in the range 1-12), the output should display: "Invalid month input".



Additional lines of output:

"Copy constructor called" will be printed when the copy constructor is invoked.
"MonthDays object is being destroyed" will be printed once for each MonthDays object when the object is destroyed.


Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ month ≤ 12

1900 ≤ year ≤ 2100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
1 2024
Output 1 :
Number of days is 31
Copy constructor called
MonthDays object is being destroyed
MonthDays object is being destroyed
Input 2 :
4 2023
Output 2 :
Number of days is 30
Copy constructor called
MonthDays object is being destroyed
MonthDays object is being destroyed
Input 3 :
2 1996
Output 3 :
Number of days is 29
Copy constructor called
MonthDays object is being destroyed
MonthDays object is being destroyed
Input 4 :
2 1999
Output 4 :
Number of days is 28
Copy constructor called
MonthDays object is being destroyed
MonthDays object is being destroyed
