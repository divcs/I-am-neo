Problem Statement



Jake is working on a project to manipulate large numbers. He needs your help to create a C++ program that replaces all occurrences of the digit '0' in a given number with the digit '1' using object-oriented programming concepts. Specifically, Jake wants you to utilize classes, member functions, and constructors to solve the problem.



Your task is to implement a C++ program that defines a class named NumberManipulator which contains the following features:

Parameterized Constructor with Initializer List: Initializes the class with a number.
Member Function: A method named replaceZeros that recursively replaces all occurrences of the digit '0' with '1'.
Destructor: Ensures proper cleanup when the object is destroyed.
Input format :
The input consists of a single long integer, n.

Output format :
The output displays the number after all '0's have been replaced by '1's.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
0 ≤ n ≤ 1011

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
10203
Output 1 :
Number after replacement: 11213
Input 2 :
100
Output 2 :
Number after replacement: 111
