Problem Statement



Sunank is working on a specialized number system that uses only the digits 3 and 4. He needs to develop a program that generates numbers in this system and retrieves specific terms from the sequence.



Your task is to help Sunank create a C++ program that should generate numbers in the unique number system up to the nth term, where n is an input integer. These numbers should be written to a file named numbers.txt, with each number on a new line.



After writing the sequence to numbers.txt, the program should read this file and output the nth term in the sequence.



The sequence begins with 3, 4, 33, 34, 43, 44, 333, 334, ...

Input format :
The input consists of an integer n.

Output format :
The output prints an integer which is the nth number of the given number system.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
3 ≤ n ≤ 1000

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
45
Output 1 :
34443
Input 2 :
7
Output 2 :
333
