Problem Statement



You are designing a seat arrangement system for a small theatre. The theatre manager wants to know the number of possible seating arrangements given a certain number of available seats and a certain number of people. 



You are required to implement this system using a C++ class called SeatArrangement.



Your class should use:

Parameterized Constructor: To initialize the number of seats and people.
Destructor: To display a message indicating that the object is destroyed.
A Method to Calculate Permutations: The class should have a method calculatePermutations() that returns the number of possible seating arrangements.
Input format :
The input consists of two long integers:

r - the number of seats.
n - the number of people.
Output format :
The first line of output displays the number of ways the people can be seated in the given number of seats.

The second line displays a message indicating that the SeatArrangement object is destroyed.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ n, r ≤ 10

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
3
Output 1 :
Number of ways people can be seated: 60
SeatArrangement object is being destroyed
Input 2 :
4
2
Output 2 :
Number of ways people can be seated: 12
SeatArrangement object is being destroyed
