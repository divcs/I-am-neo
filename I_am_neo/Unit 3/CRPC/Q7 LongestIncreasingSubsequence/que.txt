Problem Statement



Hemanth is developing a tool to find the longest increasing subsequence in an array. Write a program using a class LongestIncreasingSubsequence that demonstrates the use of constructors, destructors, and methods. The class should include a parameterized constructor to initialize the array, a destructor, and a method to find and print the length and elements of the longest increasing subsequence.

Input format :
The first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases.

For each test case:

The first line contains an integer n, the size of the array.
The second line contains n space-separated integers, the elements of the array.
Output format :
For each test case,

The first line prints the length of the longest increasing subarray.

The second line prints the elements of the longest increasing subarray separated by a space.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ t ≤ 10

1 ≤ n ≤ 10

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
1
10
11 3 1 4 7 8 12 2 3 7
Output 1 :
5
1 4 7 8 12 
Input 2 :
2
10
12 13 1 5 4 7 8 10 10 11
7
5 8 9 7 6 7 8
Output 2 :
4
