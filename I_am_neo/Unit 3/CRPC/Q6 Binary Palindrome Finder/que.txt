Problem Statement



Jake needs a program to find the A-th binary palindrome number. Implement a class BinaryPalindromeFinder that uses constructors, destructors, and initializer lists to manage the search. The class should include methods for checking binary palindromes and finding the A-th palindrome. Input an integer A and output the corresponding binary palindrome.

Input format :
The input represents the integer value of A that you need to input.

Output format :
The output consists of the decimal value of the Ath palindromic binary number.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ A ≤ 100

Sample test cases :

2
Output 1 :
3
Input 2 :
17
Output 2 :
