Single File Programming Question
Problem Statement



ï»¿Mayon is working on a banking application, and a portion of his code deals with handling withdrawal transactions from a customer's account.



Prior to processing the withdrawal, he aims to verify whether the account balance is adequate to cover the requested amount.



In case the account balance is insufficient (less than the requested withdrawal amount), Mayon plans to throw an exception of type std::underflow_error. How should he go about implementing this functionality in his banking application?



Note: This kind of question will be helpful in clearing TCS recruitment.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of the initial balance of the bank account (double).

The second line of input consists of the withdrawal amount to withdraw from the account (double).

Output format :
If the withdrawal amount is less than or equal to the account balance, the code will display the new account balance after the withdrawal.

If the withdrawal amount is greater than the account balance, the code will catch the exception of type std::underflow_error and display a simple error message indicating insufficient funds.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

1 <= initial amount, withdraw amount <= 106

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
15000
10000
