Problem Statement



Mithu is a software developer working on a program to analyze a list of numbers. Write a code that prints the composite numbers from an integer array.



Hint: Use the remove_copy_if() algorithm.

Input format :
The first line contains a single integer n, representing the number of integers in the array a.

The second line contains n space-separated integers on a single line, representing the elements of the array a.

Output format :
If the input n is not within the valid range (1 to 15, inclusive), the output prints "-1".

Otherwise, the output will display a single line containing the composite numbers (non-prime numbers) in the array a, separated by spaces.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 <= n <= 15

1 <= a[i] <= 1000: Each element in the array a will be an integer within the range of 1 to 1000 (inclusive).

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
9
4 5 12 65 89 57 584 52 111
Output 1 :
Composite numbers: 4 12 65 57 584 52 111 
Input 2 :
-2
Output 2 :
-1
