Problem Statement



Reby is developing a program that simulates a simple list of numbers. The program allows users to input 'n' integers and store them in a vector. After that, the user enters a position ('pos') to access the element at that position in the vector. To handle potential errors, you have to implement exception handling for accessing elements in the vector.



Note: This kind of question will help in clearing HCL recruitment.

Input format :
The first line consists of an integer n, representing the total number of inputs.

The second line consists of n space-separated integers.

The third line consists of an integer, representing the position to fetch.

Output format :
The output displays the element fetched from the given position (0-based indexing).

The program will display an appropriate error message if the given position is not within the range.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
n > 0

0 <= position <= n-1

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
10 20 30 40 50
2
Output 1 :
30
Input 2 :
5
10 20 30 40 50
6
Output 2 :
Exception occurred!
Not possible to fetch index 6
