Problem Statement



Thamizh is organizing a charity event to raise funds for various causes. As part of the event, he planned to conduct a unique auction for special items donated by the participants. To make the auction more interesting, he wants to ensure that each item to be auctioned has a unique starting bid.



Write a program to help you manage the unique starting bids for the auction items. The program should take input for the number of auction items (not more than 15) and their respective starting bids. However, since you want to avoid any complications during the auction, you need to ensure that each starting bid is unique. If there are any duplicate starting bids, the program should remove the duplicates and calculate the total sum of the unique starting bids.
