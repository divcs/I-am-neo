Problem Statement



In the music playlist application, offering a personalized and distinct listening experience to users is crucial. To ensure that users' playlists do not contain duplicate songs, the application has developed a custom function called getUniqueElements. 



When users create a playlist and add songs to the "songsList," the "getUniqueElements" function efficiently filters out any duplicate song IDs. As a result, users receive a new list that contains only the unique song IDs, providing a well-curated and uninterrupted music-listening experience. 

Input format :
The first line consists of the number of songs in the songsList, N.

The second line consists of N song IDs separated by a space.

Output format :
The output displays the filtered list after removing the duplicates in a sorted order.

Code constraints :
1 <= N <= 104

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
14 8 65 65 14
Output 1 :
8 14 65 
Input 2 :
5
64 64 64 64 64
Output 2 :
64
