Problem Statement



ï»¿In a gynecologist's clinic, efficiently managing doctor appointments is crucial for providing timely care to patients. The clinic maintains a record where each element represents a patient's ID based on their arrival time. To offer flexibility to patients, the clinic has designed a custom function called "removeElement" that allows patients to cancel their appointments.



When a patient requests to cancel their appointment (represented by the target patient ID), the function efficiently removes all occurrences of that patient's ID from the appointment queue, ensuring a smooth and well-organized appointment process.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of the number of patients, N.

The second line of input consists of N space-separated patient IDs.

The third line of input consists of the ID, M for which the appointment has to be canceled.

Output format :
If M is present in the patients' IDs, the output displays all IDs in exact order after removing M.

If M is not present in the patients' IDs, the output displays all IDs in exact order.

Code constraints :
1 <= M, N <= 104
